2. ENIAC = Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer   
3. The basic language for a computer is Machine Language, which consists of 1's and 0's, which means computers are consisted of integers.   
4. Application-Specific Integrated Circuits(ASIC) are the fastest parts of a computer memory.   
5. DRAM are the slowest storage device.   
6. The smallest unit of information in computer science is a bit.   
7. Assembly is the closest programming language to machine code. Assembly understands machine code and is run so that humans can interpret the program.   
8. Fortran is the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use. It was created in 1958.   
9. Assembly is a second-generation programming language. Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, and R are third-generation programming languages.   
10. C was created in the early 1970s, MATHLAB was created in the late 1970s, C++ was created in th early 1980s, and Python was created in the early 1990s.   
11. The ancestor programming language of C was B.   
12. The ancestor programming language of C++ was C With Classes.   
13. The ancestor programming language of MATHLAB was Fortran, meanwhile the ancestor programming language of Python was ABC.   
14. The fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is Registers.   
15. The smallest memory unit in the memory heirarchy of modern computers is Disks.   
16. The register memory is greater than a nanosecond, which idecates that it is faster the nanaoseconds of RAM.   
17. RAM is 100 nanoseconds, compared to a typical SSD hard drives, which is in 100 microseconds.   
18. RAM is 100 nanoseconds, compared to a typical HDD hard drive, which is 100 miliseconds.   
19. The primary roles of transistors is turning electrical current on or off. This helped in storing data, such as the machine language (binary). This also helped with how fast a computer runs. By controlling how much current, we can save more battery usage on our computers, or depending on how much transistors or in the computers, it depends on the speed of fast our computers will go.   
20. The smallers transistors get, the harder they are to function. Which is why we cannot add more transistors to a computer because that would be decreasing it's size.   
21. Fetch, Decode, Execute are the three tasks accomplished within a CPU cycle.   
22. A powerful computer with more CPU cycles can be slower than a computer with less CPU cycles because of the CPU cycles. If there are more CPU cycles in a powerful computer, it will take longer for the computer to do those certains that were asked. However, if there was less CPU cycles in computer that wasn't as powerful, they can be faster because the cycles are shorter.   
23. The bottleneck of speed in modern computers are the CPU clocks because depending on how fast the speed is, it will genuinely outperform the processors. Which is why you have to compare and look at the different modes to know which has a better processor speed and get more tasks done quicker.   
24. Dennard Scaling is the same as MOSFET scaling. Dennard Scaling implies that the more transistors we use in a computer, the faster the CPU process goes. Moore's law predicted that transitors would increase double each two years, to which his prediction lasted for many decades.

29. The three fundamental components of a Turing-comlete language are:
    1. Data
    2. Class
    3. Action
