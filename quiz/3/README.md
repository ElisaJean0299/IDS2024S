1. Name and describe briefly the steps involoved in scientific inference.   
   - It starts with a phenomena, a question that we have, called a natural phenomena. Then we observe the data that we see, and construct a model with calibration and validation. By asking ourselves the question of the phenomena and creating an inference from the data we observe along with the validation we create a prediction, which makes a scientific inference.   
2. Name the three pillars of science   
   - Experiment/Obersvation   
   - Theory/Physical Models   
   - Computational/Data-Driven Models   
3. Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two.
   - Predicting computing and numerical simulations, such as Professor Shahmoradi's photo of the Flu virus in his intro-to-data-science slides.   
   - There is the strokelesion from Professor Shahmoradi's photo of inference where the stroke might occur.
   - There is also the traffic engineering, which involves machine learning.   
4. Name two difference categories of logical reasoning and provide an example.   
   - There is a deductive reasoning and plausible reasoning:   
     - Deductive logic is a statement that can be either true or false, but cannot be both. Example of A is true then B is true: if it is rainy, then it is cloudy.   
     - Plausible reasoning example: It will rain by 10 am at the least, then the sky will become cloudy before 10 am. cloudy, then it must be rainy. This is plausible reasoning because we cannot prove that it is going to be rainy before 10 am, it could be raining at 9:50 a.m., which doesn't give us the logical certainty for it.   
5. Is logical implication and physical causation the same?   
   - Logical implication is not the same as physical causation. For example with the rain and clouds. The rain isn't the physical causation of the clouds. The clouds are the physical causation of rain, and it cannot be the same way. With Logical implications, yes the clouds can cause rain, but it is not always the same. A day can be cloudy, but have no rain.   
6. Who is the Boolean algebra named after?
   - George Boole (1854)   
7. Illustrate the logical conjunction via a Venn Diagram

8. Illustrate the logical disjunction via a Venn Diagram   
   - [disconjunction](Logical_Disconjunction.jpg)   
9. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?   
    - If two Boolean propositions are equal, that means that they hold the same truth value because they are both equally plausible.

15. Logical NAND and NOR

16. Logical implication in terms of logic functions   
    - [Logic Function](LogicaFunctions)   
17. Show work:   
    -   
18. Even though I went home to understand truth tables, it felt like there needs to be more time. I feel like there should have been more time on the venn digrams as well. I know that I probably won't do as good on this quiz. I would have liked more time to discuss.
