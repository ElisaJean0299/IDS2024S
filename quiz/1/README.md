1. README.md subfolder is complete for quiz.  
2. .md stands for
3. The git software would track the empty folders, with the addition of ".git" with is a hidden folder that is created.
4. Once '.git' is created, then every git project is saved and stored in that hidden file. So essentially yes, every git project has a '.git. folder, however it has all of the projects in one single hidden folder.
5. The purpose of the '.git' folder is store all of the new projects you have worked on into that hidden folder.  
6. cd = changing directory.
7. ls -a = listing all of the files, including the hidden files, such as '.git'.
8. pwd = parent working directory.  
9. A git project will go through the editing phase, where people would collab and edit their projects. Then they will commit changes, this allows it to go to the version database and store the saved file there. If you are wanting to transport that saved file to github, then you could push those changes from terminal, this is going towards the server computer. If you are wanting to send it to another team memeber, you could commit changes, contact your team member and they are able to see the changes, and make corrections needed on their own computer if needed. Then the cycle runs again.
10. Version Control System is a software that records changes to a file, or project, that either a singular person or a group worked on. It changes everytime someone commits a change.  
11. 6 major benefits to using Distributed VCS are speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development fully distributed, able to handle larger projects like the Linus kernel effect, and better collaboration.  
12. There is Local VCS, which is a hard VCS to allow collaboration and synchronization between team members. There is also a potential risk of the team losing all of their data. Then there is Centralized VCS, that allows accessibility to all members of the project's team. However they are only allowed snapshots of specifici versions of the project. If the central database fails, there are no backups and the history of the project is gone from exisitence. Then there is Distributed VCS, which is currently the most popular class of VCS. It allows a combination of both Local VCS and Centralized VCS, however each person is given a backup, so in case of the file being deleted, as long as one person had the most recent copy, then the file can be restored. It allows for easier collaboration, ansd smoother accessibiltiy.  
13. Git is a terminal that allows you to use Unix/Linus commands in order for you to create a project in git, which allows you to edit and make commitments in your projects and be able to push it into Github. Github is a server that allows you to work on your projects, and share with people your projects or code. You are not using Linus/Unix commands to create a directory because it is all in the server of GitHub.
14. git status = gives you a status of your project.
15. git push --all = push the changes from the local repository to the remote repository.
16. git pull = pulls the latest project revision from the remote to local repository.
17. Markdown is the Syntax used in Github that allows you edit your README.md files.
18. **Double stars from the left of the beginning of your statment and double stars on the right of your end statment allows your text to be bold!**
19. *One star from the left at the begining of your statment and one star on the right at the end of your statment allows your text to be in italics!*  
20. git init allows you to initialize an empty repository.  
21. One . allows you to go back once, meanwhile, two .. allows you to go back twice. It allows you to change directories one back or twice back!
22. pwd, outcome: /c/Users/elisa  
    git init, outcome: initialized an empty repository  
    cd git; outcome: changed directory to git
    mkdir testdir, outcome: made a directory called testdir
    This folder is in the git repository because when typing ls -a, it gives me the hidden folder of .git.
    The vim software allows us to use a text editor and make edits on our projects. By using the command wq, which means write quit, it allows us to save what we have worked on in our projects. To quit the text editor we use escape, :wq.  
    When typing cat README.md is says "This is a README.md file for the test git project of quiz1.
    To check my status I will use git status, and it says "no commits yet".
    git commit m-"This is my first commit to testdir README.md"
    After typing git status again it said I made a commit.  
23. Absolute path is embedded into the system, there are no other path to take. Meanwhile, in relative path, there are many different routes to take.
