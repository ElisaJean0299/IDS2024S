1. The fastest component of a computer memory is Registers.   
2. The modern computer memory is comprised of a multilevel (hierarchial) structure because The closer we are to the processor, the memory access speed increase. Visa versa, as the memory size shinks, so does it's speed.   
3. Disk is the slowest kind of computer storage device.
4. The memory hierarchy of modern computers from smallest to largest is as follow:   
   1. Disk   
   2. DRAM   
   3. L3 cache   
   4. L2 cache   
   5. L1 cache   
   6. Registers   
5. The smallest unit of information in computers is a bit.   
6. Humans chose binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computers because we were able to understand it better. 0 is false, which means it is off, meanwhile 1 is true, which means it is on. We can use this to understand the flow of electrical current, along with the conditional stands, AND, OR, NOT.   
7. The typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers is less than nanoseconds.   
8. The 1940s was when the first digital computer was built.   
9. The 1940s was when the first general-purpose digital computer was built.   
10. A fixed-program computer was a type of computer that had to be changed (rewritten, or rewired) in order to perform a new task.   
11. A modern-day fixed program computer is a calculator.   
12. Declarative knowledge is making a statement of truth/fact, such as A is the first letter of the alphabet. Meanwhile imperative knowledge is learning HOW to accomplish something; an example would be a recipe.   
13. Imperative V.S. Declarative Knowledge:   
    a. The letter B is the second letter in the English alphabet is declarative knowledge!   
    b. Overcast sky conditions are more likely to cause rain is a declarative statement becaues you are stating a fact!   
    c. Submit your answer to this question in subfolder 2 of quiz folder of your GitHub project is imperative knowledge, because you are giving instructions on how to submit your answers.   
    d. You must answer all questions in this quiz to get a full grade is a imperative knowledge because it stating that a task needs to be done (the quiz) in order for whoever to grade it fully.   
    e. Once done with this quiz, do not forget to commit your responses to your repository is imparative knowledge because it giving a task before completing the process.   
14. Declarative and Imparative knowledge is the class of human knowledge algorithms belong to.   
15. ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is the first digital computer.   
16. Python is the computer programming language whose evolution and populatrity is tightly coupled with the field of Bioinformatics.   
17. Fortran is the computer programming language whose evolution and poplularity is tightly coupled with the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering.   
18. The five major components of a modern digital computer is:   
    1. They must contain a main procedure that determines the control flow for the program.   
    2. they much contain a set of functions that are called to perform certain tasks during program execution.   
    3. The main and sub-main procedures have a hierarchical structure.
    4. The source code for each procedure is compiled.   
    5. All compiled procedures and the main procedure are linked together with source codes to produce a complete executable program.   
19. ENIAC is an example of a fixed-program computer.   
20. These languages are in chonological order, according to their birth date:   
    1. Fortran - 1954   
    2. COBOL - 1959   
    3. B - 1969   
    4. c++ - 1983   
    5. Java & Python - 1991   
21. Assembly language is the closest human-readable programming language to machine code. It does not need to be interpretated in order to become machine-comprehensible because Assemble code makes the binary turn into a language that humans can understand.   
22. Fortran is the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use. It is approximately +15 years old.   
23. Assembly is a second-generation programming language. Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, and R are all third generation languages.   
24. C was created in the early 1970s, MATLAB was created in the late 1970s, C++ was created in the early 1980s, and Python was created in the early 1990s.   
25. The ancestor programming language of C was B.   
26. The ancetor programmming language of C++ was C with Classes.   
27. The ancestor programming language for MATLAB was Fortran, meanwhile the ancestor programming language of Python was ABC.   
28. Log of base = to the power. For example log of base 10 = 1. Which indicates that when 10^1 it is equal to 10. It is the same for log of base of (10 * 10) = 2 because 10^2 = 100.   
29.   
    S = n/2(A+L)   
    n = 99, A = 3, L = 99   
    99/2(3+99) = 5049   
     The value of S = 5049
